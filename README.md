# Data-Cleansing-and-Integration

## TASK 1 AND 2: Data parsing and Cleansing
1. Focuses on  parsing a large XML dataset into a pandas dataframea and examining the resultant structure. 
2. Exploring the iterative techniques and procedures required to wrangle and therefore clean a large data set with unknown data quality issues. In order to work through this data in a more controlled and organised manner I decided to analyse potential data anomalies one column and at a time. 

**INPUTS**:
- Dataset1.xml
**OUTPUTS**:
- errorlist.csv: list of all changes made to the dataset 
- dataset1_cleaned.csv: Cleaned data output in csv formatt
